					Mall Customer Segmentation


Project Overview:

This project segments mall customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score using K-Means Clustering. The dataset contains customer information, and clustering helps in identifying different types of shoppers.



Model Used:

K-Means Clustering
An unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into K clusters based on similarity.



Features:

Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
Visualization of customer segments
Saved output images for reference



Files Included:

mall_customer_segmentation.ipynb => Main notebook/script containing the full code
Mall_Customers.csv => Dataset used for clustering
elbow_method.png => Elbow method plot
customer_segments.png => Cluster visalization
README.md => Project overview and instructions
requirements.txt => Python libraries used

	

Results:

The clustering process identifies five types of customers based on their income and spending patterns:

Target Customers - High spenders with high income
Careless Spenders - High spenders with low income
Careful Spenders - Low spenders with high income
Uninterested Customers - Low income, low spending
Standard Customers - Average spending habits



Conclusion

This implementation provides insights into customer behavior, helping businesses optimize marketing strategies and enhance customer experiences.
